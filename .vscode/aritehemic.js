//Addition as + 
var sum = 5 + 3; // sum will be 8

//Subtraction as - 
var difference = 10 - 4; // difference will be 6

//Multiplication as *
var product = 6 * 7; // product will be 42

//Division as / 
var quotient = 12 / 3; // quotient will be 4

//Modulus as %  Returns the remainder when the left operand is divided by the right operand
var remainder = 17 % 5; // remainder will be 2

// Exponentiation as **  Raises the left operand to the power of the right operand (ES6 and later)
var result = 2 ** 3; // result will be 8

/* Increment as (++) & Decrement (--): These are unary operators that increase or decrease a 
numeric variable by 1. */

var x = 5;
x++; // x is now 6
x--; // x is now 5 again
